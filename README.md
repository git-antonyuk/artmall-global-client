This is client side of art marketplace.
[Live](https://artmall.global)

## Frontend framework 🏗
This project was build using nuxt.js + vue.js. 
I made decision move to **next**. 
[Docs](https://nextjs.org/docs)

## Getting Started ⚙️
Use node **14**, for control version of node use nvm
```bash
nvm use 14
```
Install dependencies: 
```bash
yarn install
```
Development server:
```bash
yarn dev
```

## UI 🧱
I don't want to build component from scratch, so I added Ant design UI library + extend it by using theme overwrite.
[Ant Design Docs](https://ant.design/components/overview/)

## Styles 🎨
So, primarily I use css modules and scss. 
But for theme of ant design I also added less support. 

## Localization 🌍
i18n is the best. I used additionally this [helper](https://github.com/isaachinman/next-i18next)
